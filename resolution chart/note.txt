This script reconstructs images of a resolution chart positioned at varying z positions, with signals collected through MMF.

resolution_chart.mat contains the following variables:

1. MMF_signals_chart_*: MMF signals of reflectance light from the chart at a certain distaince away from the MMF
2. H (or V): MMF raw data and configurations of H (or V) polarization
3. N: each MMF input realization is a focal spot on a N x N foci array
4. pre_mode_ind: the number of MMF input realization during imaging
5. mode_ind: the number of actually counted MMF input realization for image rendering
