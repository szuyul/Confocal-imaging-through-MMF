# Image-reconstruction-for-confocal-imaging-through-MMF-without-wavefront-shaping

Demo code and data for two examples of 3D multi-contrast image reconstruction from signals collected through an optical MMF.

This work is published on [Optica 9(1), 2022](https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-9-1-112&id=468487), entitled: Confocal 3D reflectance imaging through multimode fiber without wavefront shaping. Please cite the paper if you use the code for your own publications.

1. The quarter waveplate sample folder is to demo accurate polarimetric imaging through MMF
2. The two-layered cell sample folder is to demo 3D imaging through MMF with various computational contrast 
3. The resolution chart folder is to demo image resolution evaluation by using a chart placed at varying distance from the MMF
4. The tool functions folder contains essential functions for demo codes. 
5. Data were collected with a 1m-long 105um-core 0.22NA step-index MMF operated at 1550 nm. See additional description of the experiments in Methods.
