This script reconstructs sample reflectance images at varying z positions from signals collected through MMF.
The sample (in air) is Thorlabs WPQ501 quater-waveplate 137um thickness, so round trip is half-waveplate

quarter_WP_45deg_rotated_data.mat contains the following variables:

1. MMF_signals_qwp: signals of reflectance light from the sample collected through a MMF
2. bf_sample_qwp: brightfield image of the sample on the front or back surface
3. H (or V): MMF raw data and configurations of H (or V) polarization
4. N: each MMF input realization is a focal spot on a N x N foci array
5. pre_mode_ind: the number of MMF input realization during imaging
6. mode_ind: the number of actually counted MMF input realization for image rendering
